# Hello-World
This is a Demo project to learn GitHub

I was learning Cassandra and he was explaining about Docker, which I didnt know anything about Docker and i started learning docker, After I have created a docker account it was asking for a repository account, which is Git Hub, and I didn't know anything about Git Hub so I started learning GitHub :-)
